CodeAlpha Internship — Task 3
Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict car selling prices using features like manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history.

Dataset

File: car data.csv

Main Columns Used:

Car_Name

Year

Selling_Price

Present_Price

Kms_Driven

Fuel_Type

Seller_Type

Transmission

Owner

Tasks Completed
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Encoding (Categorical → Numeric)

Model Training

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Model Performance Evaluation

Final Prediction Results

Key Findings
Cars manufactured recently have higher resale price

Diesel cars retain more value compared to petrol

Random Forest achieved better accuracy than Linear Regression

Higher present price → High selling price (strong correlation)

Conclusion
Machine learning helps estimate resale value accurately.
Useful for buyers, sellers, and automobile businesses to make smarter pricing decisions.
