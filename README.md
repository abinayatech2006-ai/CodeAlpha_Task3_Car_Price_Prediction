CodeAlpha Internship — Task 3
Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict car selling prices using features like manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history.

Dataset

File: car data.csv
Main Columns Used:

1.Car_Name

2.Year

3.Selling_Price

4.Present_Price

5.Kms_Driven

6.Fuel_Type

7.Seller_Type

8.Transmission

9.Owner

Tasks Completed
.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

.Feature Encoding (Categorical → Numeric)

.Model Training

.Linear Regression

.Random Forest Regressor

.Model Performance Evaluation

.Final Prediction Results

Key Findings
Cars manufactured recently have higher resale price

Diesel cars retain more value compared to petrol

Random Forest achieved better accuracy than Linear Regression

Higher present price → High selling price (strong correlation)

Conclusion
Machine learning helps estimate resale value accurately.
Useful for buyers, sellers, and automobile businesses to make smarter pricing decisions.
